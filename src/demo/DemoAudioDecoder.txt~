Showcasing different audio decoders - mostly pointless

to play a music file:
	figure out how many samples we need

	watch for SampleDataEvents
	tell the sound to play

if we catch a SampleDataEvent:
	get the data from the event

	extract a buffer full of audio into memory

	if we didn't read anything:
		we're done

	write out the memory and clear the data
