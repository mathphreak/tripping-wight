Quick LatencyCheck

make a list of tests [ 2048, 3072, 4096, 8192 ]

make a buffer

keep sounds and channels

and keep outputs

set the length of the buffer to the maximum samples possible

when we EnterFrame:
	if there are more sounds/channels to build:
		get the new sound
		tell the sound to let us know when something happens
		play the sound
	
	show some system and Flash Player info
	
	show the user all the output stuff

when we get sound:
	determine which sound we're getting
	
	write the sound into the buffer
	event.data.writeBytes( buffer, 0, TESTS[index] << 3 );
		
	if we have an output channel for this sound:
		figure out how laggy we were and add it to the outputs
