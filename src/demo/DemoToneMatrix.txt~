Simple implementation of the Tonematrix

create a new TonematrixSequencer (see below)
create a PolySynth with a SimplePolySynthVoiceFactory.INSTANCE (probably a SimplePolySynthVoice)
create a Delay with the length of a dotted eighth note

set up the GUI

set up the audio:
	add to the engine's processors the TonematrixSequencer
	add to the engine's processors the PolySynth
	add to the engine's processors the Delay
	
	PolySynth out => Delay in
	TonematrixSequencer out => PolySynth in
	Delay out => master output

this is a TonematrixSequencer:
	keep track of the note numbers [96,93,91,89,86,84,81,79,77,74,72,69,67,65,62,60]
	keep track of the on/off status of all the notes
	
	set up the pattern to be all off initially
	
	to process a block:
		figure out which sixteenth note we're on
		figure out which measure that is
		
		while we're before the end:
			if we're after the beginning:
				for all the notes we could have:
					if that note is on:
						create a new TimeEventNote
						
						set its position, note number, and duration
						tell the output about it

			move to the next sixteenth note
