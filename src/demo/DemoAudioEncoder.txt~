Showcasing different audio encoders

Renders 100 cycles of 220Hz Sinewave

make a buffer of bytes
make a WAVEncoder

frequency is 220
100 circles
phase is 0
calculate how many samples we want

while we want more samples:
	set the buffer's position to 0
	
	for all the samples that we want that fit in the buffer:
		set the amplitude to be sin(2pi * phase)
		
		write the amplitude to left and right of the buffer
		
		update the phase (add frequency / sampling rate)
		take only the fractional part of phase
	
	set the buffer's position to 0
	
	encoder.write32BitStereo44KHz( buffer, write );
	
	numSamples -= write;
}

const name: String = getQualifiedClassName( encoder.strategy );

fileRef.save( encoder.bytes, name.substr( name.indexOf( '::' ) + 2 ) + encoder.fileExt );
