Showcasing different audio encoders

Renders 100 cycles of 220Hz Sinewave

make a buffer of bytes
make a WAVEncoder

frequency is 220
100 circles
phase is 0
calculate how many samples we want

while we want more samples:
	set the buffer's position to 0
	
	for all the samples that we want that fit in the buffer:
		set the amplitude to be sin(2pi * phase)
		
		write the amplitude to left and right of the buffer
		
		update the phase (add frequency / sampling rate)
		take only the fractional part of phase
	
	set the buffer's position to 0
	
	write the buffer out to the encoder
	
	mark that we recorded those samples

come up with the file name and save it
