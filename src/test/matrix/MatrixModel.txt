Simple data structure for 2D Boolean Pattern (Like ToneMatrix)

keep track of the 2d boolean data

make a list of the IMatrixModelObserver instances we're notifying

initialize the data to all false

if we want to change a value:
	check that the value is allowable
	
	if the value is actually changing:
		change the data
		notify the observers

let people register and unregister observers
