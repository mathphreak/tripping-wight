Test implementation of a polyphonic synthesizer voice

keep track of the volume

keep track of the audio engine

we have a phase and a phase increment

we have duration and time remaining

when we start a TimeEvent:
	create a TimeEventNote
	
	set phase to be zero
	get the frequency and calculate the phase increment based on frequency
	
	set duration and time remaining to however many samples long the note should be

when we processAdd: [TODO figure this out]
	we have an envelope and an amplitude
	
	for each signal:
		if we aren't finished with the note:
			decrease the samples remaining
			set envelope to 1 - ((time remaining / duration) - 1) ^ 2
			
			set amplitude to WaveFunction.biSinus(phase) * envelope * volume [TODO figure this out]

			add amplitude to the current signal
			move to the next signal

			increment the phase and constrain it to (0, 1)
