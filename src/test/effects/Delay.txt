Simple static delay

keep a SignalBuffer of the signal output
and another SignalBuffer of the input

and a delay buffer with index and size

and a wet factor (0.5)
and a dry factor (0.8)
and a feedback factor (0.4)

when we create the delay effect:
	make the delay buffer size exactly the right number of samples
	create the delay buffer and set index to 0

to process a block:
	make a Signal from the delay buffer
	and an input and an output Signal
	
	var n: int = info.numSignals;
	
	for each signal in the block:
		read from the delay buffer
		
		write the input (plus the feedback delay) to the delay buffer
		
		mix input (dry) and delayed (wet) into output
		
		advance all three buffers
	
	advance the private buffer by the block length
	and the output buffer too
