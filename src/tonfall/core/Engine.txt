Engine runs the digital audio processing chain
and writes the last SignalBuffer into a ByteArray.

It also stores the current time position in bars and beats per minutes.

The processing chain needs to be setup manually.

there can only be one Engine

keep track of one BlockInfo

keep track of bar position
keep track of bpm (default 120)
keep track of all the processors we have
keep a buffer for master input

let users mess with bar position and bpm and processor list and the input buffer

if we're asked for a deltaBlockIndex at a position (in bars):
	return how many samples it will be until we reach that position

to render audio:
	figure out when the audio position will reach the end of the block

	tell each processor to process the block
	
	mark that we've reached the end of the block
	
	if we already have some master input buffered:
		write out our master input into the target
