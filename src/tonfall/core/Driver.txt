Standard audio driver running on flash.media.Sound

limit one Driver in existence

keep track of a sound

make an array of silence
make an array to buffer sound

keep track of the engine
keep track of a sound channel
keep track of latency
keep track of if we're running

set the sound channel to play the sound
mark that we're running

we can get the sound channel's left and right peak -- whatever that means

when we get in data:
	if we have ever been running:
		compute the latency of audio

	if we don't have an engine, or if we're not running:
		output silence
	otherwise:
		ask the engine to render some audio

		output that audio
