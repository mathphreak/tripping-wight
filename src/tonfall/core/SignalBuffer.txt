Stereo audio data linked list (looped)

keep track of the current signal
and which one it is in the list
and how long the list is

keep a real list of signals
to set it up:
	keep track of a head and a tail

	set both of them, and the first element in the vector, to be silence

	while we need more signals to be long enough:
		set the next element in the vector, and the next one after the tail, and the tail to be silence

	set the tail to point to the head as next, and set the current signal to the head

a SignalBuffer can't be longer than the block size

let people access the current signal

let people set the next however many signals to silent

let people multiply the next however many signals by a gain factor

let people get the signal at an index, wrapping the index once to fit within our private list

let people get the signal that's however many away from this one

let people advance the current state by however many signals, wrapping to fit

let people get the list of signals
