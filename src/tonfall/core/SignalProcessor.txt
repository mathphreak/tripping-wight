SignalProcessor provides sample-exact event processing.
When a TimeEvent (like a note) is located for processing inside current block,
the SignalProcessor ensures that the event will be executed at proper position.

when we're asked to process a block:
	var event: TimeEvent;
	
	var localIndex:int = 0;

	var remaining: int = info.numSignals;

	var eventOffset: int;

	while we have more events:
		peel off the first one
		
		figure out how many signals until the event starts
		
		if the event hasn't started yet:
			process enough signals to get there
			mark that we've gone that far
		
		process the event itself
		
		get rid of the event

	if there are more samples in the block:
		process them too

if we're asked to process an event:
	refuse -- this is a generic SignalProcessor

if we're asked to process some signals:
	refuse -- this is a generic SignalProcessor
