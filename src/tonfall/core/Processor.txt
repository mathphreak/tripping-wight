Processor is a member in the engine's processing chain.

A Processor can either generate audio or sequence events or both.

Every processor accepts events.

keep a list of events

keep track of the engine

if someone adds a TimeEvent:
	make sure we don't already know about it
	add it to our list and re-sort it so the events are all in order by start point

when we're asked to process a block:
	refuse -- this is a generic Processor, so it can't do anything!
