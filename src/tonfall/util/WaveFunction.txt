Creates basic waveforms

we can do /\ and ~ and /| and [ that range from either 0 to 1 or -1 to 1

all of these require phase from 0 to 1

to do /\ from -1 to 1:
	if the phase is less than half:
		return 4 * phase - 1
	return 3 - 4 * phase
	
to do ~ from -1 to 1:
	return sin(2pi * phase)

to do /| from -1 to 1:
	return 2 * phase - 1

to do [ from -1 to 1:
	if the phase is less than the width:
		return 1
	return -1

to do /\ from 0 to 1:
	if the phase is less than half:
		return 2 * phase
	return 2 - 2 * phase

to do ~ from 0 to 1:
	return sin(2pi * phase)/2 + 1/2
	
to do /| from 0 to 1:
	return phase

to do [ from 0 to 1:
	if the phase is less than the width:
		return 1
	return 0
