Metronome Sequencer sends event every beat.

keep a target

keep the time signature

to process a block:
	make sure we have a target
	
	figure out how many measures have already happened

	while we haven't reached the end of the block:
		if we have reached the start of the block:
			figure out how many beats have happened
			figure out how many bars that works out to
			figure out how many beats through the bar we are

			tell the target about a MetronomeEvent with the right properties

		move to the next beat
