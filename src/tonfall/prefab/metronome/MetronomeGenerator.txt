Sound Generator for Metronome (sinus, monophone)

keep an output buffer

make all notes 50ms

keep track of phase and phase increment and samples remaining

to process an event:
	if it's a MetronomeEvent:
		reset the phase and samples remaining

		if we're on beat 0:
			use note 84 (C6) as the beat
		otherwise:
			use note 72 (C5) as the beat

to process some signals:
	keep an envelope and an amplitude
	
	for each signal to process:
		if we have more samples remaining:
			linearly decay the envelope
			
			set the amplitude to sin(2pi * phase) times the envelope

			output that amplitude

			increment the phase contstrained to (0, 1)
		otherwise:
			output silence
