PolySynth provides a simple way to create a polyphone synthesizer.

keep an output buffer

keep a volume parameter

keep a list of active voices

keep a voice factory

to process a TimeEvent:
	if it's a TimeEventNote:
		ask the voice factory to create a new voice for this note
		
		tell the new voice to start

		add it to the list of active voices

to process some signals:
	set the next however many signals of our output buffer to 0

	for all the active voices:
		tell the voice to process the next few signals
		if it tells us it's finished:
			remove it from the list

	adjust the output buffer by the volume control
