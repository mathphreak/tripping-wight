Simple MixingUnit

Caution: No interpolation between different gains and pannings.

keep an output buffer

keep track of how many inputs we support
and all the input buffers
and have a gain and a pan for each (default gain is 0.7, default pan is 0)

we can connect and disconnect inputs
we can mess with gains and pans

to process some signals:
	keep an input buffer
	
	keep an output signal
	
	for each input:
		set the input buffer to read in this input

		if this input doesn't exist:
			skip all the processing

		set x to be the angle for pan ([pan + 1] * pi/4)
		set y to be the gain
		
		set gainL and gainR to be y*cos(x) and y*sin(x) respectively
		
		if this is the first input:
			for each signal:
				left output is just left input times left gain
				same with right output
				
				advance output and input
				
		otherwise:
			processAdd( input.current, out, numSignals, gainL, gainR );
			for each signal:
				add left input times left gain to left output
				same with right output
