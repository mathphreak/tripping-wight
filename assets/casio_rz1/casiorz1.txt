Casio RZ-1

I don't know anything about the history of the RZ-1, such as when it was made.
I needed a simple sequencer for a sound module I had, so I grabbed from a friend.
It's a very basic drum machine with a few odd features like most casio stuff.
The sounds include Tom 1, 2 and 3, Bass Drum, Snare, Rim Shot, Open HH, Closed HH, Claps, Cowbell, Ride and Crash.
It's not velocity sensitive, but it has Accent and Mute pads which can be held down will hitting the pads to increase or decrease the volume and add a small amount of dynamics.
It also has individual outputs each with their own fader for each sound besides the stereo output.
The sounds have preset pan positions.  Another interesting feature is the capability for four samples.
It also has two 'tone' knobs for adjusting the tone of the samples.
The sequencer has room for 99 patterns which can be recorded realtime or step written and 20 songs which can have 99 steps each.
The songs can be linked together.  It has MIDI IN/OUT/THRU ports and can send and receive on all 16 channels.
One last interesting feature is that it can save and load pattern and song data from cassette using its MT terminal.
